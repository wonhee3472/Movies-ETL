What I accomplished from this project is the followings:
  1. Created an automated pipeline that takes in new data;
  2. Performed transformations to parse the data, 
  3. Loaded the data into existing tables in postgres. 

The code was already written while doing the modules but I refractored it into a function to make it more streamlined than before.
